Chen, Jie (2021): The global Mid-Ocean Ridge system. figshare. Figure. [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16628449.v1](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.16628449.v1)

(a) Topography, (b) teleseismic earthquakes (Mb>4), (c) age of oceanic crust, and (d) heat flow. Datasets are from multiple sources: topography (Weatherall et al., 2015), teleseismic earthquakes (USGS, [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fearthquake.usgs.gov%2F)), crustal age (Seton et al., 2020), heat flow (Lucazeau, 2019), and the digital MOR locations (Coffin et al., 1997). AAR: American-Antarctic Ridge, AR: Arctic Ridge, CaR: Carlsberg Ridge, ChR: Chile Ridge, CIR: Central Indian Ridge, EPR: East Paciﬁc Rise, GSC: Galapagos Spreading Center, MAR: Mid-Atlantic Ridge, PAR: Paciﬁc-Antarctic Rise, SEIR: Southeast Indian Ridge, SWIR: Southwest Indian Ridge, JdFR: Juan de Fuca Ridge.
