abstract = {{Melt supply at slow‐ultraslow spreading ridges is overall reduced and highly variable. Magma cooling and crystallization substantially shape the axial thermal regime by providing heat that is lost to the ocean through conduction and hydrothermal convection. Geological data suggest that melt is emplaced over a wide depth range, variably accessible to hydrothermal cooling, and that periods of higher and lower melt supply may alternate at a given location. Until now, numerical models focused on steady‐state thermal regimes controlled by either spreading rate or melt supply, falling short at slow‐ultraslow ridges. Here we present results from a 2‐D numerical thermal model that couples repeated melt injections and hydrothermal convection. We first constrain thermal regimes inferred from two ultraslow‐spreading endmembers in melt supply at the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR): a magmatically robust endmember at 50°28'E and a nearly amagmatic endmember at 64°30'E. We adjust parameters associated with melt supply (the melt injection frequency and the temperature of the host rocks upon melt emplacement) and hydrothermal circulation (the extent and permeability of the hydrothermal system). Our simulations predict that greater melt injection frequencies unsurprisingly produce hotter thermal regimes. However, at a given frequency, melt emplacement in cooler host rocks (e.g., <800°C) causes cooler thermal regimes with transient black smoker‐type hydrothermal circulation that extracts heat efficiently. Periodic waxing and waning magma supply, as proposed from geological data at the SWIR 50°28'E, induces an oscillatory thermal regime. Transience in the axial thermo‐mechanical state may be an integral part of lower‐crustal construction at magmatically robust sections of slow‐ultraslow ridges. The thermal regime at mid‐ocean ridges reflects a dynamic balance between heat supplied by magmatic injections and cooling through hydrothermal convection. Geological observations show that slow and ultraslow spreading ridges have a diverse melt supply, which may be emplaced at a wide range of depths with variable temperatures and over periods of alternating high and low melt supply, increasing the thermal regime variability. Until now, numerical models focused on steady‐state thermal regimes controlled by either spreading rate or melt supply, falling short at slow and ultraslow ridges. We use a coupled numerical model that fuels hydrothermal convection with repeated magmatic intrusions. We constrain thermal regimes inferred from two melt‐supply endmembers of ultraslow ridges, and then explore the variability of the thermal regime by adjusting parameters associated with melt supply and hydrothermal circulation. Our simulations show that while higher frequencies of melt injections (unsurprisingly) produce hotter thermal regimes, the temperature of the host rock upon melt emplacement exerts a strong control on the geotherm. Melt injections into cold rocks could cause efficient hydrothermal heat removal and a cooler thermal regime. We also investigate how cyclic changes in melt injection frequencies produce an oscillatory thermal regime at a given ridge location.
