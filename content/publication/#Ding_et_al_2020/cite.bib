abstract = {{The recently explored Tianzuo hydrothermal field in serpentinized ultramafic rocks of the amagmatic segment of the ultraslow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge displays high-temperature sulfide mineralization (isocubanite, sphalerite, and minor pyrrhotite) and low-temperature (pyrite and covellite) phases. Pyrite can be subdivided into pyrite-I and -II, with the former generally having a pseudomorphic texture after pyrrhotite and the latter typically growing around isocubanite, sphalerite, and pyrite-I or occurring as individual grains in quartz veinlets. The sulfide minerals have the greatest range of δ34S values (− 23.8 to 14.1‰), found so far among modern sediment-starved ridges, with distinct δ34S values for low- and high-temperature mineral phases. The high δ34S values of isocubanite (9.6 to 12.2‰) and sphalerite (9.1 to 14.1‰) suggest that sulfate, which precipitated from seawater during an early low-temperature phase of hydrothermal circulation, was the main sulfur source for these sulfides. Pyrite-II has the lowest and most variable δ34S values (− 23.8 to − 3.6‰), suggesting microbial sulfate reduction. Pyrite-I has variable and generally positive δ34S values (− 0.1 to 12.0‰), with sulfur being inherited from pyrrhotite from the original thermochemical reduction of sulfate, mixed with volcanogenic sulfur. Intermittent magmatism represented by gabbroic intrusions, and high permeability caused by well-developed fractures associated with detachment faults, contributed to the formation of sulfides in the Tianzuo hydrothermal field. These factors possibly control sulfide mineralization in amagmatic segments of ultraslow-spreading ridges.}},
