Ultraslow spreading ridges, which account for ~20% of the global Mid-Ocean Ridge (MOR) system, are the least surveyed part of the MOR system, because they are mostly in hard-to-access oceans.  The longest (~7000 km), the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR), is in a remote location with the Roaring Forties, and the second longest (~2000 km), the Gakkel Ridge, is in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean. There is a challenge to state-of-the-art models of seafloor spreading from recent observations on ultraslow spreading ridges: the seafloor at the SWIR 64.5°E (an extreme case with nearly zero magma supply) is almost entirely (>90%) covered by ultramafic mantle rocks that are exhumed by successive flip-flop detachment faults, so-called detachment-detachment spreading mode ([Sauter et al., 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1771); [Cannat et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19302808)); this mode is completely new relative to faster spreading ridges. Moreover, magma supply at ultraslow spreading ridges is not overall low as expected, but extremely variable in space and time ([Cannat et al., 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GC001676); [Grevemeyer et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0124-6)). This magma supply varies from nearly zero at the SWIR 64.5°E to the other extreme at the SWIR 50.5°E (and also at Gakkel 100°E detected by the recent JASMInE cruise), where the crust is 9.5 thick ([Li et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL062521); [Jian et al., 2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JB013377)), far more than expected (3-6 km). Seafloor spreading at the SWIR 50.5°E is dominated by magmatism with few faults, almost comparable to fast spreading EPR 9°N ([Chen et al., 2021](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JB022152)). Thus, it is timely to build a more comprehensive, global-scale model for seafloor spreading by studying the missing ultraslow spreading ridges.
