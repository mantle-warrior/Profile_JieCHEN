Ultraslow spreading ridges, which account for ~20% of the global Mid-Ocean Ridge (MOR) system, are the least surveyed part of the MOR system, because they are mostly in hard-to-access oceans.  The longest (~7000 km), the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR), is in a remote location with the Roaring Forties, and the second longest (~2000 km), the Gakkel Ridge, is in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean. There is a challenge to state-of-the-art models of seafloor spreading from recent observations on ultraslow spreading ridges: the seafloor at the SWIR 64.5°E (an extreme case with nearly zero magma supply) is almost entirely (>90%) covered by ultramafic mantle rocks that are exhumed by successive flip-flop detachment faults, so-called detachment-detachment spreading mode; this mode is completely new relative to faster spreading ridges. Moreover, magma supply at ultraslow spreading ridges is not overall low as expected, but extremely variable in space and time. This magma supply varies from nearly zero at the SWIR 64.5°E to the other extreme at the SWIR 50.5°E (and also at Gakkel 100°E detected by the recent JASMInE cruise), where the crust is 9.5 thick, far more than expected (3-6 km). Seafloor spreading at the SWIR 50.5°E is dominated by magmatism with few faults, almost comparable to fast spreading EPR 9°N. Thus, it is timely to build a more comprehensive, global-scale model for seafloor spreading by studying the missing ultraslow spreading ridges.
