The thermal regime of the global Mid-Ocean Ridges (MOR) is a key control on the dynamics of seafloor spreading. It is typically assessed through numerical thermal models that balance a steady magmatic heat input with a hydrothermal output, rather than observational approaches alone. A widely-accepted thermal model by [Phipps Morgan and Chen](https://www.nature.com/articles/364706a0) (1993) successfully predicts that the basaltic solidus isotherm deepens with the decrease of spreading rate for fast-intermediate spreading ridges. However, this model falls short at slow-ultraslow spreading ridges that account for 2/3 of the MOR, where the solidus has depths ranging between 2-4 km at centers of a few magmatically-robust segments and >10 km in a common situation ([Sinha et al., 1998]([https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/135/3/731/623770]()); [Singh et al., 2006](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05105); [Li et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL062521)). I'm using a 2-D numerical model that fuels hydrothermal circulation with repeated magmatic intrusions and mantle upwelling to simulate the MOR thermal regime at all possible spreading rates and crustal thicknesses.
