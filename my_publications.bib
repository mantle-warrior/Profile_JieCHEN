abstract = {{The ultraslow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) to the east of the Melville fracture zone is characterized by very low melt supply and intensive tectonic activity. Due to its weak thermal budget and extremely slow spreading rate, the easternmost SWIR was considered to be devoid of hydrothermal activity until the discovery of the inactive Mt. Jourdanne hydrothermal field (27°51′S, 63°56′E) in 1998. During the COMRA DY115-20 cruise in 2009, two additional hydrothermal fields (i.e., the Tiancheng (27°51′S, 63°55′E) and Tianzuo (27°57′S, 63°32′E) fields) were discovered. Further detailed investigations of these two hydrothermal sites were conducted by Chinese manned submersible Jiaolong in 2014–2015. The Tiancheng filed can be characterized as a lowtemperature (up to 13.2°C) diffuse flow hydrothermal field, and is hosted by fractured basalts with hydrothermal fauna widespread on the seafloor. The Tianzuo hydrothermal field is an inactive sulfide field, which is hosted by ultramafic rocks and controlled by detachment fault. The discovery of the three hydrothermal fields around Segment \#11 which receives more melt than the regional average, provided evidence for local enhanced magmatism providing heat source to drive hydrothermal circulation. We further imply that hydrothermal activity and sulfide deposits may be rather promising along the easternmost SWIR.}},

abstract = {{The recently explored Tianzuo hydrothermal field in serpentinized ultramafic rocks of the amagmatic segment of the ultraslow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge displays high-temperature sulfide mineralization (isocubanite, sphalerite, and minor pyrrhotite) and low-temperature (pyrite and covellite) phases. Pyrite can be subdivided into pyrite-I and -II, with the former generally having a pseudomorphic texture after pyrrhotite and the latter typically growing around isocubanite, sphalerite, and pyrite-I or occurring as individual grains in quartz veinlets. The sulfide minerals have the greatest range of δ34S values (− 23.8 to 14.1‰), found so far among modern sediment-starved ridges, with distinct δ34S values for low- and high-temperature mineral phases. The high δ34S values of isocubanite (9.6 to 12.2‰) and sphalerite (9.1 to 14.1‰) suggest that sulfate, which precipitated from seawater during an early low-temperature phase of hydrothermal circulation, was the main sulfur source for these sulfides. Pyrite-II has the lowest and most variable δ34S values (− 23.8 to − 3.6‰), suggesting microbial sulfate reduction. Pyrite-I has variable and generally positive δ34S values (− 0.1 to 12.0‰), with sulfur being inherited from pyrrhotite from the original thermochemical reduction of sulfate, mixed with volcanogenic sulfur. Intermittent magmatism represented by gabbroic intrusions, and high permeability caused by well-developed fractures associated with detachment faults, contributed to the formation of sulfides in the Tianzuo hydrothermal field. These factors possibly control sulfide mineralization in amagmatic segments of ultraslow-spreading ridges.}},
